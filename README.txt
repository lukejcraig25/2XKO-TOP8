1. Do not unlock layers
-They are positioned intentionally and moving them will cause issues
2. Ensure that you are not hiding the layer folders, and only clicking the eye next to the exact layer you are un-hiding.
3. Custom background art can be added by replacing the bottom "Background" layer. There is a template with character safe zones for the vertical layout template currently saved in the zip. This can be used to create art that does not conflict with the character/fuse square placements.
